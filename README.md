Virtual Reality is cool. You can travel to places without the hassle of packing your bags, sleeping in a hotel with bed bugs, airport delays, missing your flight. It can take you to virtual worlds that never exist - In the comfort of your pajamas.

With this new technology, we need to reimagine how we interact with Virtual Reality. It's the interaction that makes it real - Visual, sights, sounds, ambiance. The smell, the wind, all our sensory perception.

That's the reason why I started to look into this. What are the next era of interacting with Virtual Reality. And as makers, we are part of this process. We are the bridge. We can take Virtual Reality to the next level.

This is part of a 6 series project exploring Virtual Reality as a Maker. We're not going to create games we are going to explore different ways to create new experiences and interact in VR.

First - Voice Interaction. Amazon Echo is an amazing household appliance. It has replaced the music, radio player at my house. I got it connected to my home automation. It can control TV, Lights, Sounds. I can ask for weather, traffic information and current news. How about Virtual Reality? We can definitely use it to control my Virtual Reality experience too.
